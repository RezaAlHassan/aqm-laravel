* 7 modfified charts, initially collected from Highcharts
* A dashboard that shows latest air quality data for the user's location detected using geolocation
* An admin panel access for overview of computed charts table
* User Authentication for access to admin panel 
* Database shown in a user friendly table, where you can perform CRUD operations
* The data that is shown in the charts can be viewed in the "Charts-Table" sidebar option
* Data queried from Database using Laravel Query Builder and SQL

#### Map
The daily air quality index (AQI), which represnts the quality of air incliding pollutants today, is shown for all districts

#### Yearly Line Chart
The amount of main pollutant in Bangladesh, known as PM2.5, is collected for each day every year in the seven districts of Bangladesh in the database. The data for each district, each year, is combined and averaged using SQL commands and query builder functions. So the data shows the yearly average data for each year, for each district. The data is then shown in the graph using a line graph, y axis being average PM2.5 and x axis representing the years.

#### Box Plots
The amount of main pollutant in Bangladesh, known as PM2.5, is collected for each day every year in the seven districts of Bangladesh in the database. The average, lower quartile, upper quatrile, minimum and maximum of the data is shown in yearly and seasonal box plots.

#### Daily Line Chart
The amount of main pollutant in Bangladesh, known as PM2.5, is collected for each day every year in the seven districts of Bangladesh in the database. The daily data for each district is queried using SQL commands and query builder functions. The data is then shown in the graph using a line graph, y axis being average PM2.5 and x axis representing the districts.
